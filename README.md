## Introduction

Alastria red B Network is a public-permissioned Blockchain network that uses the [Hyperledger BESU](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/besu) technology, [IBFT 2.0](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Tutorials/Private-Network/Create-IBFT-Network/) consensus algorithm, and it's managed by [Alastria](https://alastria.io/en/) partners, :vulcan_salute:.

There are 2 main steps to set up an Alatria Node:

**1. Installation & configuration:** Follow the Docker installation steps and your node will be ready.

**2. Getting permissioned:** In order to use Alastria Network, your node must be previously accepted. 


If you are a _rookie_ in Blockchain or Ethereum please consider reading these references:

- https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/
- https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/BESU/Hyperledger+Besu

If you would like you to know more about [Hyperledger](https://www.hyperledger.org/) Ecosystem, this [link](https://www.hyperledger.org/use/tutorials) is a good start.

## Administrative requirements

[Alastria](https://alastria.io/en/) partners can add its own node. Otherwise contact support@alastria.io to start with administrative permissioning.

There are 2 main steps to set up an Alatria Node:

**1. Installation:** Follow the installation process and your node will be ready to be permissioned.

**2. Getting permissioned:** In order to use Alastria Network, your node must be previously accepted, after filling the form. 

If a member wants to remove a node from the network, please send us a **removal request** using the same [electronic form](https://forms.gle/UCnATiaJ4LPdGjP97).


# 1) Installation

### Node Types
- Users who want deploy applications should use [Regular node Installation Guide](docs/Regular-Configuration&Installation.md)
- Users who want to improve the availability of the network should add a `Core Node`. Keep in mind the dedicated use of these nodes and the special security considerations for these core nodes. Please, open a Issue to be evaluated by Core Team.

### Option 1 - baremetal

The following guide is ready for installation on a dedicated machine (bare metal, virtual machine,...), with data files stored on `/data` partition.
**Please**, consider the following guide to add a [dedicated disk](docs/mount-dedicated-disk.md) for the node database, independent of the system disk.

### Option 2 - docker-compose

Read the following guide to make a [Regular Node Installation with Docker](docs/Configuration%26Installation-with-docker.md)

# 2) Permissioning new node

Please, fill this [electronic form](https://forms.gle/mcJNnTE81Z3P1g8K6) and provide the following information in order to get the permission for joining the network:

* The exact Node Name.
* The public IP for your node. Get your public IP, for example, with `curl ifconfig.me`. Remember that the hosting should be in _Eurozone_.
* The hosting provider for your node, in case you use one. Otherwise, use `SelfHosting`.
* The system configuration: number of cores, memory and harddisk reserved for the node.
* Enode direction. You can find it in `/data/alastria-node-besu/keys/nodeAddress` file, or using `curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"admin_nodeInfo","params":[],"id":1}' http://127.0.0.1:8545`.


# Infraestructure details

## System requirements

- Operating System: Ubuntu 16.04/18.04/20.04 LTS 64 bits. CentOS, Redhat,... and other _rpm_ systems are also allowed.

- Hosting: Euro Zone; in order to complain with GDPR directives.

- Hardware:

| Hardware       | Minimum | Desired |
| :------------- | :------ | :------ |
| **CPU's**:     | 2       | 4       |
| **Memory**:    | 4 Gb    | 8 Gb    |
| **Hard Disk**: | 32 Gb   | 256 Gb  |

Blockchain database is about 16Gb at mid-2021 and grows at rate of 2Gb/month. Take this into consideration when provisioning space for cache, logs etc.

## Firewall configuration

You need to open the following ports to deploy a node:

### Incoming rules

| Port  | Type | From          | Definition                                   |
| :---- | :--- | :------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| 30303 | TCP  | 0.0.0.0       | Ethereum client data transfer ports          |
| 30303 | UDP  | 0.0.0.0       | Ethereum client listener and discovery ports |
| 9545  | TCP  | 185.180.8.152 | External Prometheus metrics                  |

Notes:

- Logging from `185.180.8.152` is needed in order to pull metrics from `red B` [Network Monitor](https://alastria-netstats2.planisys.net:8443/?orgId=1) (Thanks [Planisys](https://www.planisys.net/) :raised_hands:)

### Optional ports:

| Port | Type | From            | Definition                                        |
| :--- | :--- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| 8080 | TCP  | (orion parners) | Orion port (in case you use private transactions) |
| 8545 | TCP  | (web3 client)   | json+rpc (in case you use remix/truffle/.../web3) |
| 8546 | TCP  | (web3 client)   | json+ws (in case you use remix/truffle/.../web3)  |

Notes:

- :warning: Please, be very carefull opening web3 ports: this protocol does not have enabled (natively) neither authentication nor encryption!
- :warning: Opening web3 ports, can be tuned in `/data/alastria-node-besu/config/config.toml` file: listening interface, `web3` methods available,...
- Ninja sysadmins don't use outbound firewall rules :joy:

## FAQ

- How to launch an interactive console for debugging purposes?

```sh
$ sudo /data/alastria-node-besu/bin/besu --config-file="/data/alastria-node-besu/config/config.toml"
```

- How to know if the node is already permissioned?

```
2021-04-29 14:58:44.465+00:00 | EthScheduler-Services-5 (importBlock) | INFO  | FullImportBlockStep | Import reached block 10145800 (0x82c9..ea34), Peers: 1
```

The last column should show, at least, one "Peer".

- How to know if the node has finished syncing?

Use `eth_syncing` [method](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/web3.eth.html#web3.eth.Eth.syncing) to see the synchronization progress:

```sh
$ curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_syncing","params":[],"id":1}' http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

- How can I manage the node?

Enable this object at the node: add "ADMIN" to the list of supported methods:

```sh
$ sudo vim /data/alastria-node-besu/config/config.toml

[...]
rpc-http-api=["ADMIN", "ETH","NET","WEB3"]
[...]
```

```sh
$ curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"admin_peers","params":[],"id":1}' http://127.0.0.1:8545
$ curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"admin_nodeInfo","params":[],"id":1}' http://127.0.0.1:8545
```

Other `ADMIN` methods, in https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/stable/Reference/API-Methods/

- Will the functionality (docker | ansible | whatever) be supported soon?

It's in your hands! [Alastria](https://alastria.io/en/) is an open group and everyone is welcome to contribute. If you need any support we are here to help :hugs:

- Connection from Remix
  (TBD)

- Connection from Truffle
  (TBD)
